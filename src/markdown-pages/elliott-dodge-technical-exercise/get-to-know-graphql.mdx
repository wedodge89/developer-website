<Intro>
The purpose of this guide is to introduce you to the GraphQL language and GraphiQL environment.

Throughout the five lessons of this course, we will practice using GraphQL to query New Relic's API and your New Relic data.

By the time you finish this workshop, you will be ready to use GraphQL to search and edit all kinds of data and optimize your New Relic experience.

</Intro>

## Before you begin

In order to use GraphiQL, you will need a New Relic account and API key.

* If you do not yet have a New Relic account, you can create one at the [signup page](https://www.newrelic.com/signup).
* Once you have created your account (or if you already had one), you will need to generate an API key for use with GraphiQL. Start by navigating to [New Relic One](one.newrelic.com) and clicking on the arrow beside your profile picture in the top-right corner.
* From the drop-down menu, select "Account settings".
* On the **Account settings** page, find and click "Users and roles" under the *ACCOUNT* heading.
* This will open the **Users and roles** page in a new tab in your browser. In the *Users* list, find your account and click on either the name or email address. This will open the **User information** page for that user.
* From there, find and click the *API keys* tab, and then the *New API key* button. When prompted, click "Yes, create API key" and voila, you are the proud owner of a new API key for use with GraphiQL.

## 0. Your first GraphQL query

Now it's time to get your hands dirty with GraphQL and GraphiQL. To start, open [GraphiQL](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) in your browser.

<Steps>

  <Step>

    When you open GraphiQL, you will be greeted by a simple sample query to get you started. Try clicking the **Play** button to execute the example query. Your results should look something like this:

    {/* This is where the first image goes. Results of sample query. */}

  </Step>

  <Step>

  One of the advantages of GraphQL is that it enables the client, rather than the server, to determine which pieces of
  information a query returns. To demonstrate this, let's see if we can return the user's email, in additon to their name.

In the query panel on the left side, press enter/return after the name field and type ```email``` on the new line. 

    <Important>

      As you type, GraphiQL provides type-ahead suggestions. These suggestions are based on the GraphQL schema. We will cover that in the next lesson.

    </Important>

    Once you have added the email, press the **Play** button again. Your result should look like this:

{/* Second Image here. Results of query with name and email. */}

  </Step>

</Steps>

And just like that, you have successfully completed your first custom GraphQL query. Next, we will dive deeper into the GraphQL schema.

## 1. The GraphQL Schema

One of GraphQL's definining characteristics is that it is strongly typed. This means that developers can specifically choose which information is available to the GraphQL service. This is done with a GraphQL schema. Schemas provide flexibility for developers to add details about the data they return. To that end, each field has a description that the developer can use to indicate how the data is to be used. 

Schemas also empower developers to build tools that ensure proper query construction and data use. One use for this is to indicate deprecated fields, enabling tools like GraphiQL to discourage use of that data. 

Now it's time to explore what kind of information we can uncover using GraphiQL.

<Steps>

  <Step>

    To start, open [GraphiQL](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and click the ```< Docs``` button in the upper right. This will open a side panel to the right that shows available fields for New Relic's GraphQL service.

    <Important>
      GraphQL has two entry points, ```query``` and ```mutation```. Queries return information from New Relic. Mutations alter information.
    </Important>

  </Step>

  <Step>

    Click ```RootQueryType``` on the list in the panel you just opened. This will show the top-level fields for querying in GraphQL. You will notice ```actor``` in this list, which you might recognize from the previous lesson. You will also see that ```actor``` is at the very top level of the JSON structure in your Query Builder.

  </Step>

  <Step>

    Click on ```actor``` in your right-side information panel for more information about this field. If you click ```Actor``` in the pane that follows, you can see a list of fields contained within the ```actor``` field, including ```users``` and ```accounts```. Try entering the following query in the left panel.

    <Important>
      
      ```
      {
        actor {
          user {
            name
            email
          }
          accounts {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
      ```

    </Important>

  </Step>

  <Step>

    When you run this query, the GraphQL server fetches the requested information for all accounts that the user, you, has access to. When the queries are all finished (or when they timeout or encounter an error), GraphQL does the heavy lifting of assembling the result and returning it to the GraphiQL client. Your results should look something like this:

    {/* Third image */}

  </Step>

</Steps>

Now you should have a better understanding of the New Relic data model, as well as how you can modify your queries to return just the right information. 

A typical REST API would require at least two different API calls, and maybe two different API keys, to do this. Not to mention that GraphiQL gives you the ability to specify exactly what data you want, so as to avoid over-fetching. When querying, you can add only the fields you need, omitting anything you're not currently looking for. 

  <Step>

Once the sample application is successfully served, go to the local New Relic One homepage: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local and click **Add Time Picker**:

  <Important>

If you don't see any launchers, click **Your applications**.

  </Important>

![New Relic One launcher image](../../images/time-picker-guide/homepage-launcher.png)

  </Step>

</Steps>

After launching the **Add Time Picker** application, you see a dashboard that gives an overview of the transactions in your New Relic account:

![Transaction overview application](../../images/time-picker-guide/add-timepicker.png)

By default, the application shows your data within the last 60 minutes. If you toggle the time picker, it doesn't update the charts because the transaction overview application isn't connected to the New Relic One platform. It has no access to the data from the time picker. 

In the following sections, you'll add the time picker to the example application and add the time to the queries.

## Import the `PlatformStateContext` component

The first step in adding the time picker is to import the `PlatformStateContext` component. 

<Important>

  If you need more details about the `PlatformStateContext` example that follows, see the [APIs and components page](/components/platform-state-context)
 
</Important> 

Here's what the `PlatformStateContext` component does:

* Wraps all of the code within the return statement of the render method
* Makes a function call passing in the New Relic platform state
* Returns all of the code within our current return statement

Complete these steps:

<Steps>

<Step>

In a text editor, open `/add-time-picker/nerdlets/nr1-howto-add-time-picker-nerdlet/index.js`.

  </Step>

  <Step>

Add the `PlatformStateContext` component to the end of the import statement so it looks like this:

  ```jsx
  import {
    Grid,
    GridItem,
    HeadingText,
    AreaChart,
    TableChart,
    PieChart,
    PlatformStateContext
  } from 'nr1';
  ```

</Step>

  <Step>

Just below the current `return` insert this code for the `PlatformStateContext` component:

  ```jsx
  <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
      {(platformState) => {
  return (
  // ADD THE CURRENT RETURN CODE HERE
  )
  }}
</PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
```

  </Step>

  <Step>

Move the current application code so it is under the `return` of the `PlatformState` function call. The `return` statement should now look like this:

  ```jsx
  return (
      <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
          {(PlatformState) => {
              return (
              <>
                  <Grid
                  className="primary-grid"
                  spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]}
                  >
                      <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                          <main className="primary-content full-height">
                          <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                              Transaction Overview
                          </HeadingText>
                          <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview} />
                          </main>
                      </GridItem>
                      <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                          <main className="primary-content full-height">
                          <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                              Average Response Time
                          </HeadingText>
                          <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime} />
                          </main>
                      </GridItem>
                      <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                          <main className="primary-content full-height">
                          <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                              Response Code
                          </HeadingText>
                          <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes} />
                          </main>
                      </GridItem>
                      <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                          <main className="primary-content full-height">
                          <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                              Transaction Errors
                          </HeadingText>
                          <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount} />
                          </main>
                      </GridItem>
                  </Grid>
              </>
              );
          }}
      </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
  );
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>

Add a `console.log` statement to make sure you are seeing appropriate data. Insert the following code inside the `PlatformState` return statement just before the opening tag for the `<Grid>` component:

  ```jsx
  /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */
  console.log(PlatformState);
  ```

  </Step>

</Steps>

After you complete these steps, your browser console displays something like this:

![Browser console image](../../images/time-picker-guide/console.png)

## Add the time to the queries

In your console, you should see some data from the New Relic platform state. Now you are ready to add `timeRange` data to update the charts in the transaction overview application.

This step requires you to import the `timeRangeToNrql` utility method from the New Relic One community library.  

<Important>

You can get more details on the New Relic One community library from our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-community).

</Important> 

This helper method takes your `PlatformState.timeRange` duration data, formats it from milliseconds, and returns a formatted `SINCE` statement to add to your `NRQL`. 

<Steps>

  <Step>

Import the `timeRangeToNrql` method by inserting this line of code below the other `import` sections:

<Important>

You don't need to include the `AccountDropdown` from the community import example.

</Important> 

  ```jsx
  import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community';
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>

Pass the `PlatformState` to the `timeRangeToNrql` helper, and save its output as a `since` statement for later use:

  ```jsx
  const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState);
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>

After creating the `since` variable, go through the code in the `PlatformStateContext` return statement and concatenate the `since` variable in each of the existing chart component queries. Here's a `TableChart` example:

  ```jsx
  <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview+since} />
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>

After you update all of the chart components, confirm that the final `index.js` file looks similar to this:

<Important>

This completed sample code is in your `nerdlet final.js`.

</Important>


  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import {
    PlatformStateContext,
    Grid,
    GridItem,
    HeadingText,
    AreaChart,
    TableChart,
    PieChart
  } from 'nr1';
  import { timeRangeToNrql } from '@newrelic/nr1-community';

  export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component {
      constructor(props){
          super(props)
          this.accountId = 1;
      }
      render() {
          const avgResTime = `SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES AUTO `;
          const trxOverview = `FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) as 'Transactions', apdex(duration) as 'apdex', percentile(duration, 99, 95) FACET appName `;
          const errCount = `FROM TransactionError SELECT count(*) as 'Transaction Errors' FACET error.message `;
          const responseCodes = `SELECT count(*) as 'Response Code' FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode `;

          return (
              <PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
                  {(PlatformState) => {
                      /* Taking a peek at the PlatformState */
                      console.log(PlatformState)

                      const since = timeRangeToNrql(PlatformState);
                      console.log(since);

                      return (
                      <>
                          <Grid
                          className="primary-grid"
                          spacingType={[Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE, Grid.SPACING_TYPE.NONE]}
                          >
                              <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                                  <main className="primary-content full-height">
                                  <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                                      Transaction Overview
                                  </HeadingText>
                                  <TableChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={trxOverview+since} />
                                  </main>
                              </GridItem>
                              <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                                  <main className="primary-content full-height">
                                  <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                                      Average Response Time
                                  </HeadingText>
                                  <AreaChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={avgResTime+since} />
                                  </main>
                              </GridItem>
                              <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                                  <main className="primary-content full-height">
                                  <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                                      Response Code
                                  </HeadingText>
                                  <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={responseCodes+since} />
                                  </main>
                              </GridItem>
                              <GridItem className="primary-content-container" columnSpan={6}>
                                  <main className="primary-content full-height">
                                  <HeadingText spacingType={[HeadingText.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM]} type={HeadingText.TYPE.HEADING_4}>
                                      Transaction Errors
                                  </HeadingText>
                                  <PieChart fullWidth accountId={this.accountId} query={errCount+since} />
                                  </main>
                              </GridItem>
                          </Grid>
                      </>
                      );
                  }}
              </PlatformStateContext.Consumer>
          );
      }
  }
  ```

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Summary

When you completed all the steps in this example, you successfully implemented the time picker in your application by importing the `PlatformStateContext` component and accessing its `timePicker` data object.
