## 2. Querying Infrastructure

In this section, we will query various pieces of information within New Relic Infrastructure. This information will be used to update settings in the next section.

### Browsing Infrastructure

To start, you will want to familiarize yourself with what infrastructure integrations are available to you in New Relic. In the example below, you will see *Billing*, *DynamoDB*, and other services available for **Amazon Web Services**.
<Steps>

  <Step>

Before moving forward, take some time to explore what is available to you. Click the ```Configure``` link to see your options and current settings. 

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Querying Infrastructure

Now we are going to use GraphQL to retrieve information about infrastructure. Start by going to [GraphiQL](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

<Steps>

  <Step>

First, copy and paste the query below into GraphiQL.

  </Step>

  <Step>

Before clicking play, replace the value of account(id: ) with your personal account number. 

  </Step>

<Important>

You can find your account id in the URL of your New Relic instance. For instance, in the URL https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/630060/integrations, the account id would be 630060.

</Important>

```jsx
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_GOES_HERE) {
      cloud {
        linkedAccounts {
          id
          externalId
          name
          authLabel
          provider {
            id
            name
            slug
          }
          integrations {
            id
            name
            service {
              id
              slug
              name
              createdAt
              updatedAt
              provider {
                name
                id
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Essentially, this query asks to return all of the providers linked to your account and the services that each one offers. 

<Important>
  
  Note that we are nesting our requests. That is to say, we are getting information about the parent (in this case, a cloud provider) AND the services offered. Rather than multiple REST API calls, GraphQL is able to retrieve this information in one fell swoop.

</Important>

Your results should looks something like this (depending on your enabled integrations):

```jsx

  "data": {
    "actor": {
      "account": {
        "cloud": {
          "linkedAccounts": [

                "slug": "aws"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Steps>

### Cloud Configuration details

Now let's dive deeper into a specific service. In this case, we will look at ```tag``` and ```metricsPollingInterval```, both of which we will set using a ```mutation``` in the next section.

To do this, we will need to use the ```interfaces``` feature of GraphQL. When your query returns multiple types of data (in the previous example we asked for *all* types of cloud integration configurations) you can use interfaces to get information specific to each type of data. In the query below, we have added two clauses to accomplish this:

```jsx
... on CloudDynamodbIntegration{
  metricsPollingInterval
  tagKey
  tagValue
  updatedAt
}
... on CloudRedshiftIntegration{
  metricsPollingInterval
  tagKey
  tagValue
  updatedAt
}
```

The ```...``` on ```<interfaceName>``` functions as a sort of switch statement for your data. If your query finds a result of type ```CloudDynamodbIntegration``` or ```CloudRedshiftIntegration```, then it will also return the ```metricsPollingInterval```, ```tagKey```, ```tagValue```, and ```updatedAt``` fields. 

Copy and paste the query below into GraphiQL and click ```Play```.

```jsx
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_GOES_HERE) {
      cloud {
        linkedAccounts {
          id
          externalId
          name
          authLabel
          provider {
            id
            name
            slug
          }
          integrations {
            id
            name
            service {
              id
              slug
              name
              createdAt
              updatedAt
              provider {
                name
                id
              }
            }
            ... on CloudDynamodbIntegration{
              metricsPollingInterval
              tagKey
              tagValue
              updatedAt
            }
            ... on CloudRedshiftIntegration{
              metricsPollingInterval
              tagKey
              tagValue
              updatedAt
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Important>

  **Note**: Sometimes GraphiQL does not make it easy to discover interface names. The best way to determine if there are any interfaces available is to look at the documentation. You could also type ```... on``` and press ```ctrl + space``` to bring up the type-ahead menu.

</Important>

You can see in the result that the ```DynamoDb``` and ```Redshift``` configuration information objects contain the extra fields specified in our new query.

```jsx
{
                  "id": 177195,
                  "metricsPollingInterval": 900,
                  "name": "Redshift",
                  "service": {
                    "createdAt": 1497364366,
                    "id": 21,
                    "name": "Redshift",
                    "provider": {
                      "id": 1,
                      "name": "Amazon Web Services"
                    },
                    "slug": "redshift",
                    "updatedAt": 1534242454
                  },
                  "tagKey": "mdw-test",
                  "tagValue": null,
                  "updatedAt": 1544435410
                },
                {
                  "id": 177184,
                  "metricsPollingInterval": 900,
                  "name": "DynamoDB",
                  "service": {
                    "createdAt": 1470991758,
                    "id": 13,
                    "name": "DynamoDB",
                    "provider": {
                      "id": 1,
                      "name": "Amazon Web Services"
                    },
                    "slug": "dynamodb",
                    "updatedAt": 1534242454
                  },
                  "tagKey": "mdw-test",
                  "tagValue": null,
                  "updatedAt": 1549499902
                },
```

And just like that, you have successfully queried information from New Relic's Infrastructure offering.

You also learned how to use interfaces to get addtional information regarding specific cloud infrastructure types. Next up, we'll update the polling intervals of some services. We will need your account id again, so be sure to hold on to that.

## 4. NRQL While You WorkQL

This final exercise will incorporate the New Relic Query Language, or NRQL, into GraphQL. We will also see how to add an alias to your request. Aliases are especially useful when you have multiple similar requests contained within a query. Let's get to it!

### Basic GraphQL Query with NRQL

<Steps>

  <Step>

For starters, copy and paste the query below into GraphiQL and click ```Play``` to run it. 

  </Step>

```jsx
{
   actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_GOES_HERE) {
      nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES AUTO") {
        results
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your results will look like this (they may well include many more results, but this should give you the idea):

```jsx
{
  "data": {
    "actor": {
      "account": {
        "nrql": {
          "results": [
            {
              "beginTimeSeconds": 1548946238,
              "endTimeSeconds": 1548948038,
              "facet": "Origami Portal",
              "appName": "Origami Portal",
              "count": 601
            },
            {
              "beginTimeSeconds": 1548948038,
              "endTimeSeconds": 1548949838,
              "facet": "Origami Portal",
              "appName": "Origami Portal",
              "count": 595
            },
```

And just like that, you have a ton of detailed information from the New Relic database. But the fun doesn't stop there. Remember that with GraphQL you can issue multiple requests at once. Just watch!

  <Step>

Copy and paste this into GraphiQL and run it:

```jsx
{
   actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_GOES_HERE) {
      nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES AUTO") {
        results
      }
     nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 12 hours ago COMPARE WITH 12 hours ago TIMESERIES AUTO") {
        results
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  </Step>

Did you get the results you expected? Probably not. Even though both requests get executed, only the last results object gets returned. If you don't believe us, try switching the two queries and see what results are returned.

Aliases to the rescue! Using aliases, you can name each results object so that they are returned as two different (and differently named) objects. 

  <Step>
    
Copy the query below, noting the addition of the ```PageViews``` and ```Transactions``` aliases in front of each ```nrql``` statement.

  </Step>

</Step>

```jsx
{
  actor {
    account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_GOES_HERE) {
      PageViews: nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES AUTO") {
        results
      }
      Transactions: nrql(query: "SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 12 hours ago COMPARE WITH 12 hours ago TIMESERIES AUTO") {
        results
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Your results should look more like this (you can expand the data sections for more in-depth information):

### More Fun with NRQL

Take some time to experiment with NRQL to see what other information you can return with a ```nrql``` query. Don't forget that you can use type-ahead to see all possible values.
